              Only 8% of people stick with their New Year’s resolutions. Why? Making new habits is difficult. Many of the current habit apps don't help either - they simply track behaviour instead of changing it. A new approach is needed.
          </div><div class="image" data-v-38d280fb><img data-v-38d280fb src="https://data.ixdshowcase.com/cockpit/storage/uploads/StudentImages/Benjamin Reimer/reimer-ben_why.jpg"></div></div><div class="content how" data-v-38d280fb><div class="text" data-v-38d280fb><h2 class="s4 italic q" data-v-38d280fb>How</h2>
              Stacks takes a research-backed approach to habits by drawing from studies in habit formation and human psychology. Utilizing a habit stacking strategy, social normative influence, and loss aversion it removes the difficulty in making new habits.
          </div><div class="image" data-v-38d280fb><img data-v-38d280fb src="https://data.ixdshowcase.com/cockpit/storage/uploads/StudentImages/Benjamin Reimer/reimer-ben_how.jpg"></div></div><div class="content what" data-v-38d280fb><div class="text" data-v-38d280fb><h2 class="s4 italic q" data-v-38d280fb>What</h2>
              Stacks is a progressive web app for building and maintaining good habits. Habits are structured into collections, ‘stacks’, which can be completed alone or with friends. Perspective and motivation is kept through building streaks of successes. A feedback loop ensures users are able to overcome any difficulties they face along the way, helping them build habits that last.

This is where the form of a facilitated workshop came about.',what:'From the scenario that museum institutions and First Nations people will co-author exhibits, "Uncover Discover Another" aims to establish psychological safety at the start. The framework stands as a guided workshop paired with a web app tool. Participants use time away from the workshop to self-reflect on their values, hopes and fears to then create core values of the team and exhibit. This framework hopes to bring compassion and understanding for one another, as only a step closer to decolonizing the museum.',_by:"5c92339e3230361dca00000a",_mby:"5c92339e3230361dca00000a",_modified:1554865074,hero_image:{path:"cockpit/storage/uploads/StudentImages/Harmoney Lee/Harmoney-Lee---lee_harmoney_header_1920x1080-2.png"},hero_video:"",why_image:{path:"cockpit/storage/uploads/StudentImages/Harmoney Lee/Harmoney-Lee---lee_harmoney_why_1920x1080-2.png"},how_image:{path:"cockpit/storage/uploads/StudentImages/Harmoney Lee/Harmoney-Lee---lee_harmoney_how_1920x1080-2.png"},what_image:{path:"cockpit/storage/uploads/StudentImages/Harmoney Lee/Harmoney-Lee---lee_harmoney_what_1920x1080-2.png"},_created:1554303723,_id:"5ca4caeb3230361dca0002b2",linkedin:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/harmlee/",instagram:"harmoniouslee",thumb:{path:"cockpit/storage/uploads/StudentImages/Harmoney Lee/Harmoney-Lee---lee_harmoney_thumbnail_600x600-2.png"},profile_image:{path:"cockpit/storage/uploads/StudentImages/Harmoney Lee/217476-375757 - Harmoney Lee - Mar 31, 2019 1107 PM - lee-harmoney_avatar_1500x1500.png"}},{first_name:"Hiba",last_name:"Ahmed",slug:"hiba-ahmed",email:"ahmhiba@hotmail.com",portfolio:"www.ahmhiba.com",twitter:"",behance:"",dribbble:"",github:"",medium:"",other_social:"",project_name:"iOS Remote",project_skills:"UX, UI",project_theme:"Entertainment",bio_short:"A storyteller that aims to bring together two passions and two worlds, film and design.",bio_long:"A film enthusiast, Hiba’s passion and expertise lie in storytelling, film production and design.
